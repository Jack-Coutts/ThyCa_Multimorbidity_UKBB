***Abstract:*** *Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy worldwide and has reached epidemic levels in recent years. Diagnostic techniques for thyroid cancer have significant limitations and the disease is often diagnosed alongside other conditions. Multimorbidity refers to the coexistence of at least two chronic conditions in a single individual and the term comorbidity, for the purpose of this work, refers to a disease that co-occurs with the reference disease. Multimorbidity is becoming an increasingly important priority for clinicians, researchers, and health authorities due to the substantial impact it has on individuals and health authorities globally. Multimorbidity has a disproportionally large effect on patient mortality for cancers with less severe diagnoses and this is highly relevant for thyroid cancer where the 10-year survival for 95% of individuals is 90%. Some research has suggested that approximately 20% of deaths in thyroid cancer patients are due to multimorbidity rather than the primary disease. Despite this, little is known about thyroid cancer multimorbidity.*

*The growing focus on data collection and existence of large biomedical databases have allowed researched to start using machine learning techniques to address problems like multimorbidity. This work looked to use unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify comorbidities of thyroid cancer using data from the UK Biobank database. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering and association rule mining were used to identify association rules between other disease and thyroid cancer as well quantify the strength of the relationships. Several known disease relationships and some previously undescribed comorbidities were identified here, with a key finding being the identification of eye cancer as a comorbidity of thyroid cancer.*

## Data Source 

This research was conducted using data from UK Biobank, a major biomedical database: [www.ukbiobank.ac.uk](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).

Specifically, this work used binary disease and medication data for 394,884 and 294,699 individuals respectively. The relationship between 786 diseases and thyroid cancer was examined as well as the relatioship between three drugs prescribed for thyroid cancer and the 786 diseases.
